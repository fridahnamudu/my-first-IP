    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Fridah Joy Namudu</strong>.Born in the <em> 21st century</em> and the youngest in my
      family.</P>
    <h2>My backgroung</h2>
    <p>I was well brought up by my loving and strict parents.<span class="unimportant">My mother a teacher and my father  who worked in the army.</span>
      Accustomed to being around primarily adults,I think I was always mature for my age and occassionaly get offended
      by my peers.</p>
      <p> Being the youngest in the family,I was priviledged to go to the best considered schools in the region at the
      time.That is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Blossoms Academy- served as a daycare</li>
          <li>St.Mary's nusery - from baby class to when i joined class one</li>
          <li>Victory Junior Academy- class 1 to 8</li>
          <li> Booker Academy - Form 1 to Form 4</li>
          <li> Moringa School - Prep School.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>My intrests</h2>
        <p>When I was growing up my brother occassionaly played music in the house and i would dance to the tune.I've
        loved it since then.He listened to the kinds of:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> The late Brenda Fassie</li>
            <li>The late Michael Jackson</li>
            <li>Backstreet boys</li>
            <li>Westlife</li>
        <p>  In highschool, I began to tire of the pressure placed on me by my family and their high expectations.I
          stopped participating in extra-curricular activities including music,dance and  science fairs hence spending
           more time on my books.</p>
      <h2>My hobby</h2>
        <p>I loved painting since i was young.I was always fascinated by different colors and murals.I remember
          i would stare at large paintings whenever my parents took me out.Growing up i built my painting skills
          and my love for painting has never been less.</p>
    <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <p>I was lucky enough to emerge the best in art and Kiswahili in my highschool and for sure it will be kept
        in my school records</p>

    <h3> Reasons why i joined Moringa prep school</h3>
      <p>The main reason why i joined Moringa was that I was going to take an engineering course in university and i thought knowing how to code
      will literraly favour me in terms of job opportunities and a bit of my university course work.I really felt
      I was wasting alot of time sitting at home doing nothing and i just decided why not enroll at Moringa for
      a prep course.</p>
