    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Fridah Joy Namudu</strong>.Born in the <em> 21st century</em> and the youngest in my
      family.</P>
    <h2>My backgroung</h2>
    <p>I was well brought up by my loving and strict parents.My mother a teacher and my father worked in the army.
      Accustomed to being around primarily adults,I think I was always mature for my age and occassionaly get offended
      by my peers.</p>
      <p> Being the youngest in the family,I was priviledged to go to the best considered schools in the region at the
      time.That is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Blossoms Academy- served as a daycare</li>
          <li>St.Mary's nusery - from baby class to when i joined class one</li>
          <li>Victory Junior Academy- class 1 to 8</li>
          <li> Booker Academy - Form 1 to Form 4</li>
          <li> Moringa School - Prep School.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>My intrests</h2>
        <p>When I was growing up my brother occassionaly played music in the house and i would dance to the tune.I've
        loved it since then.He listed to the kinds of:
          <ol>
            <li> The late Brenda Fassie</li>
            <li>The late Michael Jackson</li>
            <li>Backstreet boys</li>
            <li>Westlife</li>
          In highschool, I began to tire of the pressure placed on me by my family and their high expectations.I
          stopped participating in extra-curricular activities including music,dance and science fairs.</p>
      <h2>My hobby</h2>
        <p> 

    <h3> Reasons why i joined Moringa prep school</h3>
    <p> First i just had interest in coding seeing my brother's passion and actually the way he coded was just
      beautiful.Also i was going to take an engineering course in university and i thought knowing how to code
      will literraly favour me in terms of job opportunities and a bit of my university course work.I really felt
      I was wasting alot of time sitting at home doing nothing and i just decided why not enroll in Moringa for
      a prep course.</p>
