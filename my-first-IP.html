    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h2> Sweet childhood</h2>
    <p>  In <strong>2001,25 August,</strong>i was born from a very humble background and down to earth parents.
  I was the lastborn of a family of five and one step brother.Very innocent and quiet.My
  mother a teacher and father who works in the army and is rarely seen at home.<p>
    <h2>EUCATION</h2>
    <p>  My education was not that complicated ,from a daycare to nusery school ,to primary
      then came highschool and now <em>Moringa School.</em></p>
      <p>Here is a list of the schools ive attended when growing up</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blossoms Academy- served as a daycare</li>
        <li>St.Mary's nusery - from baby class to when i joined class one</li>
        <li>Victory Junior Academy- class 1 to 8</li>
        <li> Booker Academy - Form 1 to Form 4</li>
        <li> Moringa School - Prep School.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3> Reasons why i joined Moringa prep school</h3>
    <p> First i just had interest in coding seeing my brother's passion and actually the way he coded was just
      beautiful.Also i was going to take an engineering course in university and i thought knowing how to code
      will literraly favour me in terms of job opportunities and a bit of my university course work.I really felt
      I was wasting alot of time sitting at home doing nothing and i just decided why not enroll in Moringa for
      a prep course.</p>
